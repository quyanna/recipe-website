    <p><em>"I substituted the two cups of water for 2 quarts water, and substituted the 2 tablespoons of water for 2 banana peels, and substituted the freezing with boiling the water and the banana peels together. It was ok."</em> - Gam Gam</p>
    <p><em>"I had no water at the time so I had to dissolve some ice cubs. I put them in a tray. They were done 5 hours later. The ice cubes were very good. Great recipe. 100/10. :)"</em> - ethanjelly14</p>
